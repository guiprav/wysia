Wysia
===

Wysia ("What you see is awesome!") is in essence an HTML template + mock data viewer.

It is meant to showcase web designs with the least amount of duplication by using the same templates used in the final web site or application.

It can also be used together with PhantomJS in order to comprehensively unit test your web site's appearance -- taking photos of elements and comparing them to saved ones. Ever wondered how many pages and elements are affected by a CSS change? PhantomJS and Wysia could help.

Wysia starts a server that serves all Handlebars templates in a directory, backed by the specified JSON files.

See [the Documentation](https://github.com/n2liquid/wysia/wiki/Documentation) for more information.
